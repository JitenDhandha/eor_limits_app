notes:
    - This is a note about the data, e.g. the k-bins calculated assuming logarithmic spacing.
    - This is another note about the data, e.g. extra k-bins were privately acquired from the author.

# delta_squared, k, k_lower, k_upper should always (if not blank) be 2D arrays with shape (N_z, N_k)
# z, z_lower, z_upper should always (if not blank) be 1D arrays with shape (N_z,)
# k, k_lower, k_upper are in units of h Mpc^-1
# delta_squared are always in units of mK^2
